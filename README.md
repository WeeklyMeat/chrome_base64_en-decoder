# A Chrome extension for easy base64 encoding

The extension can be used by easily clicking on the icon. Paste in your base64 decoded texts, and they will immediatly be encoded!

#### Disclaimer
I did it in my free time as a really small project. There may be more efficient ways to do it.

The code will produce errors because the preview updates live and when typing character by character it may be not correclty base64 encoded. The errors are, at least in my opinion, nothing to worry about.

When special characters are used, it won't encode anything, as it's no correct base64 decoded text.
